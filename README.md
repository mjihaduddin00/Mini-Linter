# Mini-Linter
This is my project submission where I was tasked to create a something similar to typical word processing software by performing linting (a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application). This application utilizes Vanilla JavaScript (more specifically, this application uses for loops, arrays, iterators, and array methods).
